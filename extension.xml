          <p> This add-on installs a Git Client in Oxygen. It contributes multiple
            side-views, each one specialized for various Git operations. The main one is called the
              <i>Git Staging</i> view. Using the Git Client add-on, various Git operations can be
            performed, such as committing changes into the local repository, pushing/pulling changes
            to/from the remote repository, creating, checking out and deleting branches, showing the
            history of the repository resources, and more. The add-on also includes a built-in tool
            for comparing and merging changes. </p>

          <ol>
            <li> Added a new field in the login dialog box for authentication using a personal

            <li> When pulling the remote changes for a repository that contains submodules, the
              submodules are updated as well (by default). This behavior depends on the <i>Update
                all submodules after pulling changes from the remote repository </i> option from the
                <i>Git Client</i> preferences page in Oxygen. </li>

              behavior can be disabled by deselecting the <i>Checkout branch</i> option in the
                <i>Create branch</i> dialog box. </li>
            <li> The <i>Git Staging</i> side-view has been slightly redesigned and now has a cleaner
              look. </li>
            <li>Added support for Dutch localization.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where debugging the Git Client using Apache Log4j did not work. </li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where opening submodules that required authentication was not
              possible. </li>
            <li>Fixed various other bugs and added several small UX improvements. </li>

          <ol>
            <li> Added an "Abort merge" button for when conflicts result after a <i>Pull (merge)</i>
              operation. It allows you to abort the current conflict resolution process. </li>
            <li>Added a set of options in the Git Client preferences page that can be used to decide
              whether to always switch to a newly detected working copy from a project, to never
              switch, or to always ask. </li>
            <li>Added a "Preferences" action in the Settings menu that acts as a shortcut to the Git
              Client preferences page. </li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where pushing to a remote branch did not work when local and upstream
              branch had diffenrent names. </li>
            <li>Integrated numerous other bug fixes, UI improvements, and speed improvements. </li>

              </b> , which presents all the local and remote branches as a tree. Actions were added
              to the tree's contextual menu to make it very easy to check out branches, and to
              create or delete branches. </li>
            <li>You can now easily switch between local branches using a drop-down menu in the
              top-right corner of the Git Staging view or by using the Git Branch Manager. </li>
            <li> A new action ( <b>Reset "[branch_name]" to this commit</b> ) was added in the
              history table that can be used to undo changes by moving the HEAD of the current
              branch to the selected commit. </li>
            <li> Some editor variables are now supported, including: <ul>

              Client) that contains a "Notify me about new commits in the remote repository" option.
              When this option is selected, Oxygen will show notification messages when it detects
              that new commits have been pushed to the remote repository. </li>
            <li>Support for French localization was added.</li>
            <li>The JGit component included in the Git Client was updated to version 5.9.0. </li>
